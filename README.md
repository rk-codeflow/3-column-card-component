## Overview

This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


### The challenge

Its been few days I have started learning React and styled components. After knowing how to build and integrate components in React, I decided to apply my knowledge.

While building, I faced one main challenge i.e.  Providing separate style for separate components (as the card here are made using the concept of components).
